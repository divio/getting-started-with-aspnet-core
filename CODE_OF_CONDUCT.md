# Code of Conduct

## Welcome to Our Open-Source Community

This collaborative project strives to create an inclusive and welcoming environment. We value all contributors' and participants' interactions that reflect courtesy, respect, and kindness.

We have a zero-tolerance policy for any form of abuse or harassment.

If you have concerns about behaviour, please reach out to Divio at info@divio.com.

Reports will be treated confidentially and taken seriously. The project maintainers may take appropriate action, including exclusion from participation in this and other projects, if necessary.

## Guidelines for Code Review

Code review is a crucial but sometimes challenging process for contributors and reviewers. It involves constructive critique, and improvements are often needed before accepting contributions.

We expect contributors to recognize that all aspects of their submissions, including code and underlying ideas, will be carefully reviewed.

Reviewers are encouraged to provide feedback sensitively and respectfully, aligning with our shared goal for the project's success.
