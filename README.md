[![Deploy to Divio](https://img.shields.io/badge/DEPLOY-TO%20DIVIO-DFFF67?logo=docker&logoColor=white&labelColor=333333)](https://control.divio.com/app/new/?template_url=https://github.com/divio/getting-started-with-aspnet-core/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

Welcome to our QuickStart template â€“ your portal to swift application development and seamless local testing. Whether you're delving into ASP.NET for the first time or optimizing your workflow, our template, based on [Docker Images for ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/host-and-deploy/docker/building-net-docker-images) guide, has got you covered.

## Cloud Setup

Create a [Divio Account](https://control.divio.com/) and choose **ASP.NET Core** from the template selection when creating a new application. Alternatively, click the `Deploy to Divio` button above and follow the app creation wizard. Finally, deploy your app to the `test` or `live` environment.

For in-depth details about Divio Cloud, refer to the [Divio documentation](https://docs.divio.com/introduction/).
